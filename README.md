# Linear Programming

Linear programming is a model that consists of linear relationships representing a firm’s decision(s), given an objective and resource constraints.

Linear programming is a family of problems that optimize a linear equation (an equation of the form y = ax₁ + bx₂ + …).
Linear programming will have the following components:
•	A cost function that we want to minimize: c₁x₁ + c₂x₂ + … + cₙxₙ. Here, each x₋ is a variable and it is associated with some cost c₋.
•	A constraint that’s represented as a sum of variables that is either less than or equal to a value (a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + … + aₙxₙ ≤ b) or precisely equal to this value (a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + … + aₙxₙ = b). In this case, x₋ is a variable, and a₋ is some resource associated with it, and b is how much resources we can dedicate to this problem.
•	Individual bounds on variables (for example, that a variable can’t be negative) of the form lᵢ ≤ xᵢ ≤ uᵢ.
